This connector models Oregon APACD data into the Tuva claims input layer for downstream processing and analytics.

## Pre-requisites
1. You have data from Oregon APACD
2. You have [dbt](https://www.cloud.getdbt.com/) installed and configured (i.e. connected to your data warehouse)

[Here](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation) are instructions for installing dbt.

## Getting Started
Complete the following steps to configure the package to run in your environment.

1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your local machine or environment
2. Create a database called 'tuva' in your data warehouse
    - Note: this is optional, see step 4 for further detail
3. Configure [dbt_project.yml](/dbt_project.yml)
    - Fill in vars (variables):
        - source_name - description of the dataset feeding this project
        - input_database - database where sources feeding this project are stored
        - input_schema - schema where sources feeding this project is stored
        - output_database - database where output of this project should be written.  
            We suggest using the Tuva database but any database will work.
        - output_schema - name of the schema where output of this project should be written
4. Review [sources.yml](/sources.yml)
The table names are the same as in the [Oregon APACD data dictionary](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/APAC%20Page%20Docs/APAC-Data-Dictionary.xlsx).  If you decided to rename these tables:
    - Update table names in sources.yml
    - Update table name in medical_claim and eligibility jinja function
5. Execute `dbt build` to load seed files, run models, and perform tests.
